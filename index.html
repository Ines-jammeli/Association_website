<h1> Bring back life to these cute pets </h1>

<p> Unfortunately in Tunisia, there are hundreds and hundreds of stray cats and dogs. Apart from the difficulty of finding what to eat, they are constantly exposed to road accidents, children bullying and especially to killing. From time to time, there are several campaigns accross Tunisia to kill stray dogs, stating that the aim is to reduce the number of stray animals in urban spaces and prevent the spread of rabies. These animals deserve a better life. To reduce the number of suffering pets, join our fight to protect them. They have the right to live a happy life. </p>

<h1> Be carful to their feelings </h1>

<p> Once adopted, try not to tell them that they are adopted or at least to be diplomatic when announcing that ! <b> They are emotionally fragile !!! </b> </p>
